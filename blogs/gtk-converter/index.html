            <h2>The "Why?"</h2>
            <img alt="a conversation between me and my friend barish on discord that says: 'barish, consider, what if we made a linux app that is based on imagemagick and does file conversions and doesn't look like absolute garbage'" src="image0.png" class="embed-image">
            <p>
                I have wasted a lot of my time searching for a reasonable tool that lets me convert images easily. It's also questionable if you should upload your images online to convert them, espicially if these websites are not open-source. I have found that ImageMagick tool is very good at this. However it's only CLI and almost all attempts to make a GUI for it turns out to be a very complicated design. I use GNOME desktop environment mainly and have decided to make a GUI tool based on the updated graphics tool GTK4 and Libadwaita.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                First and foremost, it should have a simple interface that looks good with GNOME. Second, it should be completely offline and never make any web requests. Third, it should easily be installed from any Linux distro.
            </p>

            <h2>The "How?"</h2>
            <p>
                I don't have a prior experience developing applications for Linux. So I decided to start with something <i>simpler</i>. Here's a helpful advice, if you can't create app, find another app that achieves similar goals and fork it. Now you must review the code and learn from it. After you get a general idea of what's going on, you should be able to make the necessary changes to implement your app.
            </p>
            <p>
                To follow the previously mentioned advice, I decided to fork <a href="https://gitlab.com/TheEvilSkeleton/Upscaler" target="_blank">Upscaler</a>. The interface is very similar to what I have in mind, so I decided to give it a try.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                After a few weeks of work. I got Converter running and it's now available for all Linux users to install through <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gitlab.adhami3310.Converter" target="_blank">Flathub</a> as a Flatpak. The source code is available on <a href="https://gitlab.com/adhami3310/Converter" target="_blank">Gitlab</a>. It supports JPG, PNG, WEBP, SVG, HEIF/HEIC, BMP, AVIF, JXL, PDF, TIFF, PDF, GIF, and ICO. It also supports resizing images using multiple functions. It also supports splitting animated pictures into their individual frames. Finally, it supports batch processing of images. I made an application for Converter to be added into the <a href="https://circle.gnome.org/">GNOME circle</a>. Wish me success in that!

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>
                I learned how to develop GUI apps with GTK4 and Libadwaita. I learned how to maintain Flatpak apps on the Flathub. I learned how i18n works with gettext. I learned how to work with a team of strangers, reply to issues and pull requests.
